      "ai_msg": "Blue Origin is an American private aerospace manufacturer and sub-orbital spaceflight services company headquartered in Kent, Washington. It was founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com. The company is developing a variety of technologies, with a focus on rocket-powered vertical takeoff and vertical landing (VTVL) vehicles for access to suborbital and orbital space. The company's name references the blue planet, Earth, as the point of origin.",

      "ai_msg": "Blue Origin has made several significant contributions to private spaceflight over the years. Here are few key milestones:\n\n1. New Shepard: Named after astronaut Alan Shepard, this fully reusable spacecraft has made multiple sub-orbital test flights. The New Shepard is designed to carry six passengers on sub-orbital space tourism flights. \n\n2. New Glenn: This is a larger orbital launch vehicle currently under development. Its aim is to carry humans and payloads to orbit and beyond. \n\n3. BE-4 Engine: Blue Origin is developing the BE-4, a powerful engine designed to end U.S. reliance on Russian rocket engines for launching national security payloads. \n\n4. Lunar Lander: Blue Origin revealed a mockup of a lunar lander called the \"Blue Moon\", designed to carry payloads\u2014and potentially humans\u2014to the surface of the moon. \n\n5. In July 2021, Blue Origin launched its first human flight, with a crew including Jeff Bezos, his brother Mark, Wally Funk (an 82-year-old aviation pioneer and the oldest person to travel to space), and Oliver Daemen (at 20, the youngest person to travel to space). The sub-orbital journey lasted for about 10 minutes and 10 seconds.\n\nIts broader goal, as stated by founder Jeff Bezos, is to create a future where millions of people can live and work in space.",
